# Material-Prediction-and-Design

This project is an entry for the AI4Science Hackathon hosted on DEVPOST.
We have do the following 3 tasks - 
- 1. Improve the current model to predict the properties of material based on their composition.
- 2. To handle the missing data.
- 3. To find a way to predict compositions from a given set of desired properties.

This repository contains a python notebook that contains the code that carries out the above mentioned tasks.

Libraries used: 
numpy  
pandas  
pytorch  
matplotlib.pyplot  
seaborn  
sklearn  

How to run: 
Just download the python notebook and toy_alloy_data.csv dataset in the same directory and run it using Jupyter notebook or Google Colab
